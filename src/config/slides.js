      "For as long as I can remember, video games have been a huge part of my life. Even after a bad or stressful day I would come home and flip open my DS and escaped into whatever I was playing. Video games became such a positive part of my life that I dreamed from an early age to be able to make my own games and fanatsy worlds someday. My love for video games is still strong today and there is not a night where I am not glued to my PS5.  ",

`Reading got me through very stressful and lonely times especially during middle school. When I was in the 5th grade, my parents wanted to take me out of public school and enroll me in a private Catholic school where they hoped I would get a better education. It was scary moving to a new school midway through and enrolled into somewhere where I did not know anyone. I remember coming to my first class very early and trying to introduce myself to one of the kids, he did not even look at me or acknowledge me making me feeling very uncomfortable from the start. Later other kids came into class and started hanging around the kid who gave me the cold shoulder, soon after the first kid came to ask me my name again. When I told them my name was Marco all the kids started laughing and the first kid yelled "Marco Polo!" and everyone chimed in and laughed. I never felt so embarrassed in my life and I soon realized this was going to be a regular occasion. My love of video games faded away during this time because many of the kids at my new school said anything other than COD was not cool and I felt embarrassed that I enjoyed a wide variety of games and playing them made me feel awkward. One day I decided to do something other than play video games and so I went to my parent's bookshelf to find something to read. I picked up "Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stong" and when I opened that book I instantly forgot about everything happening in my real life and got sucked in to the magical world of Harry Potter. Reading soon became a big part of my life because matter what happened at school, I always felt excited to come back home and escape into a good story. My love for reading is still as strong as it was back then and has given me so much happiness and also helped me grow into the person I am today. `,
  "My parents love to travel and I have been lucky enough to visit countries all around the world such as Egypt, France, Italy, Lebanon, and even Dubai! It was amazing to see how every country's culture and architecture is so unique and it made me really appreciate the places I visted. Traveling a lot got me out my comfort zone by making mestep away from other activites and experiencing new things.  ",
  "Me and my sister were raised by some of the most kindest and honest people and I endless fond memories of our trips, dinner boardgames, and even just hanging out in the family room together. My friends have known me since high school and they are still my closest friends today. Getting older and moving farther from both my close friends and family has been hard, but has also made me realize how much I appreciate that they were such a big part of my life.  "]
